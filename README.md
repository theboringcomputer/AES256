# About
AES256 is a Windows application written in Microsoft Visual C++ that offer encryption and decryption. It use symmetric key algorithm, Which mean it use the same key to encrypt and decrypt your data.
<br>
<br>
This source code has been released and fully tested on Windows 11 Operating System.

# Is AES256 is secure

AES256 has a key length of 256 bits, supports the largest bit size and is practically unbreakable by brute force based on current computing power standards. If you still don’t understand how big it is, let’s put it this way. It’s so big that it’s exponentially greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe.

# How does AES256 encrypt your data
The basic concept of encryption is that the cipher replaces each unit of information with another one, Depending upon the security key. For example, AES256 completes 14 rounds of encryption, Making it incredibly secure. The steps involve dividing the data into blocks, Replacing different bytes, Shifting rows and column mixing.

# How does AES256 decrypt your data
In decryption, The process begins with the inverse round key. The algorithm then reverses every action. Namely, Shifting rows, Byte substitution, and column mixing, Until it deciphers the original data.
